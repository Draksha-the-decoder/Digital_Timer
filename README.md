# Digital Timer

## Overview

Digital Timer is a simple web-based application that functions as a digital timer with start, stop, and reset features. This project was created to apply and reinforce learning in JavaScript, specifically focusing on concepts such as events, `addEventListener`, conditional logic (`if-else` statements), and functions.

## Features

- **Start Timer:** Initiate the timer to begin counting.
- **Stop Timer:** Pause the timer at its current count.
- **Reset Timer:** Set the timer back to zero.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The core programming language used to implement the timer functionality.
- **HTML:** Provides the structure and elements for the web interface.
- **CSS:** Adds styling to enhance the visual appeal of the timer.

## Implementation Details

The timer utilizes the `setInterval` function in JavaScript to achieve the countdown functionality. The buttons in the user interface are equipped with `addEventListener` to capture user input and trigger the corresponding actions in the JavaScript code. The timer's behavior is determined by the logic implemented using `if-else` statements.
